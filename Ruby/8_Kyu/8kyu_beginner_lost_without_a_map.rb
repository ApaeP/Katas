# BEGINNER  LOST WITHOUT A MAP (8 kyu)

# Instructions
# Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.
# For example:
# [1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]
# For the beginner, try to use the map method - it comes in very handy quite a lot so is a good one to know.

# Solution
def maps(x)
  x.map { |i| i * 2 }
end
