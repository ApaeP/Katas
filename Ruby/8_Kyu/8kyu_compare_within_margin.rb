# Codewars - Kata Solution
# COMPARE WITHIN MARGIN (8 kyu)

# Instructions
# Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b. a is "close to" b if margin is higher than or equal to the difference between a and b.
# When a is lower than b, return -1.
# When a is higher than b, return 1.
# When a is close to b, return 0.
# If margin is not given, treat it as zero.
# Example: if a = 3, b = 5 and the margin = 3, since a and b are no more than 3 apart, close_compare should return 0. Otherwise, if instead margin = 0, a is lower than b and close_compare should return -1.
# Assume: margin >= 0
# Tip: Some languages have a way to make arguments optional.

# Solution
def close_compare(a, b, margin = 0)
  margin >= (a - b).abs ? 0 : a < b ? -1 : 1
end
