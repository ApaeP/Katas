# FOR TWINS 2 MATH OPERATIONS (8 kyu)

# Instructions
# Task:
# A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you.The bricks width and height are equal, forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will except these parameters:
# radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
# bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
# rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
# And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.
# Note:
# All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim.
# All inputs are integers.
# Examples:
# ice_brick_volume(1, 10, 2) # => 16
# ice_brick_volume(5, 30, 7) # => 1150

# Solution
def ice_brick_volume(r, bottle, rim)
  ((r * 2 / Math.sqrt(2)) ** 2 * (bottle - rim)).round
end
